WAMPee7
=======

A library implementation of WAMP using JSR-365 for Websockets (Java EE7), based off the [WAMPlay](http://github.com/blopker/WAMPlay) project. Should work with GlassFish 4.0, TomCat, etc. as long as it supports Java EE7 howveer only tested with GlassFish 4.0.

## Example
### GlassFish 4.0
[GlassFish 4.0](https://github.com/bbody/GlassFishWAMP)
Or:
Add Controllers as an entry point to the project. [Example](https://github.com/bbody/GlassFishWAMP/blob/master/src/main/java/ws/wampee7/controllers/entry/EntryPoint.java)
